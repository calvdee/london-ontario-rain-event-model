station|station name|The station name is the official name of any meteorological station in the National Climate Archive as administered by the Meteorological Service of Canada.
date||The date of the observation
maxTemp|maximum temperature (°C)|The highest temperature in degrees Celsius (°C) observed at a location for a specified time interval.
minTemp|minimum temperature (°C)|The lowest temperature in degrees Celsius (°C) observed at a location for a specified time interval.
meanTemp|mean temperature (°C)|The mean temperature in degrees Celsius (°C) is defined as the average of the maximum and minimum temperature at a location for a specified time interval.
heatDegDays|heating degree-days|Heating degree-days for a given day are the number of degrees Celsius that the mean temperature is below 18 °C. If the temperature is equal to or greater than 18 °C, then the number will be zero. For example, a day with a mean temperature of 15.5 °C has 2.5 heating degree-days; a day with a mean temperature of 20.5 °C has zero heating degree-days. Heating degree-days are used primarily to estimate the heating requirements of buildings.
coolDegDays|cooling degree-days|Cooling degree-days for a given day are the number of degrees Celsius that the mean temperature is above 18 °C. If the temperature is equal to or less than 18 °C, then the number will be zero. For example, a day with a mean temperature of 20.5 °C has 2.5 cooling degree-days; a day with a mean temperature of 15.5 °C has zero cooling degree-days. Cooling degree-days are used primarily to estimate the air-conditioning requirements of buildings.
totalRainMM|total rain (mm)|The total rainfall, or amount of all liquid precipitation in millimetres (mm) such as rain, drizzle, freezing rain, and hail, observed at the location during a specified time interval.
totalSnowCM|total snow (cm)|The total snowfall, or amount of frozen (solid) precipitation in centimetres (cm), such as snow and ice pellets, observed at the location during a specified time interval.
totalPrecipMM|total precipitation (mm)|The sum of the total rainfall and the water equivalent of the total snowfall in millimetres (mm), observed at the location during a specified time interval.
snowOnGroundCM|snow on the ground (cm)|The depth of snow in centimetres (cm) on the ground. The total depth of snow on the ground at the time of the observation is determined in whole centimetres by making a series of measurements and taking the average.
dirOfMaxGust10sDEG|direction of maximum gust (10's deg/tens of degrees)|The direction of the maximum gust (true or geographic, not magnetic) from which the wind blows. Expressed in tens of degrees (10's deg), 9 means 90 degrees true or an east wind, and 36 means 360 degrees true or a wind blowing from the geographic north pole. This value is only reported if the maximum gust speed for the day exceeds 29 km/h.
spdOfMaxGustKMH|speed of maximum gust (km/h)|The speed in kilometres per hour (km/h) of the maximum wind gust during the day. The gust is the maximum or peak instantaneous or single reading from the anemometer (the instrument used to observe wind speed) during the day. The duration of a gust typically corresponds to an elapsed time of 3 to 5 seconds.
